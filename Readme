Small backend that allows clients to post ips.

Made to avoid depenencies on services like dyndns.org etc

If the client only posts a name to the server then the ip is taken from the request, otherwise the posted ip will be used.

Curl example:
curl -i -X POST --user user:password -d '{"Name":"<name>", "Ip":"<Ip>"}' http://hostname/

see scripts/ipsync.rb for example (ruby) script
